-- | The class which powers all of the serialization and compatibility logic
-- between CPU and GPU data types.
--
-- If a type instances 'ShaderData', it means it can be serialized according to
-- the [Shader Memory Layout](https://docs.vulkan.org/guide/latest/shader_memory_layout.html) (using 'Poke') into
-- a primitive datatype ('PrimTy') such as @V 3 Float@, which has a matching
-- [SPIRV type](https://registry.khronos.org/SPIR-V/specs/unified1/SPIRV.html#_types).
--
-- You can derive @'Poke'@ instances automatically (provide this using
-- @gl-block@ (TODO: May be hard bc of top-level info)). Another simple way to
-- get a 'Poke' instance is to convert the type to its primitive representation
-- and then leverage that representation's 'Poke' instance.
--
-- We could also require both Poke and Block and poke @Base = write430 and poke @Extended = write140@
--
-- Or perhaps we don't need 'Poke' at all, because we don't need type level alignment, only size?
class -- (âˆ€ lay. Poke ty (lay :: Layout)) => -- ROMES:TODO: We can't migrate to 'Poke' yet, drop 'Syntactic' first.
    Block ty =>
    ShaderData ty where

  -- | The primitive FIR shader type whose memory representation matches the result
  -- of serializing this datatype using 'Poke'. This is the promise that if
  -- your shader expects @FirType ty@ in a uniform location, writing @ty@ into the
  -- buffer will be sound, and the shader will find @ty@'s laid out in memory
  -- according to @FirType ty@'s expected memory layout.
  --
  -- === _Example_
  --
  -- @
  -- instance FirType Vec3 where
  --   type FirType Vec3 = V 3 Float
  --
  -- instance FirType Mat4 where
  --   type FirType Mat4 = M 4 4 Float
  --
  -- instance FirType ... where
  --   type FirType ... = Struct ...

  type family FirType (ty :: Type) :: Type

  -- ROMES:TODO: Perhaps we could instead have a family whose return kind is
  -- lifted 'SPIRV.PrimTy', and comparing that is easy (as long as we implement
  -- ShaderData for the common shader datatypes such as V 3 Float).
  -- Though that is quite considerably more burdensome (e.g. images, decorations...)
  -- Not sure if would be better.
  -- type family SpirType ty :: 'SPIRV.PrimTy

  -- | A proof that that the @Poke/SizeOf@ of the "primitive" FIR shader type
  -- matches the @Block/PackedSize@ of the CPU-level datatype. Even though this
  -- isn't a full blown proof that the types are compatible with respect to the
  -- expected memory layout by the graphics pipeline/shader, it nudges use of
  -- 'ShaderData' in the right direction.
  --
  -- Possibly, the greatest benefit for now is guaranteeing the type result of
  -- 'FirType' is actually a FIR primitive shader type, since we only have Poke
  -- instances for those.
  --
  -- ROMES:TODO: I'm not sure how it will work with images... they don't instance 'Poke'.
