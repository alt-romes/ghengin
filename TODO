[ ] Use parent component, a cached world matrix?, and a wrapper api that threads entities ids
[ ] Textures to use with MinMax terrain height
[ ] Complete the phong model (and try some Specular lighting)
[ ] Scene graph should (polymorphically?) cull the space, and
in the visible space order meshes by pipeline and material
type. Good algorithm that sorts geometry in the best possible way for the engine
[ ] Free render pipelines
[ ] Should each static material have its own descriptor set which simply gets bound instead of writing always over the one created with the pipeline?
[ ] Validate at compile time the meshes and materials registered for a render pipeline
[ ] Scene graph (BSP, quad/octtree)
[ ] Automatically derive UISettings
[ ] Disallow non-uniform scaling so that calculating the normal in world space is simpler
[ ] Who's pulling in lens? Maybe I can benefit from them if I already have to have them.
[.] Bundle descriptor sets, render passes, and pipelines into a single abstraction
[ ] Toon Shader
[ ] MonadRenderer to be able to call mesh creation and such from SystemT
[ ] Linear types for resource management
[x] Index buffer
[ ] Since for now we decide a game can ever only use one window, we could have the Ghengin monad propagate the window thorought the program
