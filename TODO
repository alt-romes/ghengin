[ ] Automatically derive UISettings
[ ] Disallow non-uniform scaling so that calculating the normal in world space is simpler
[ ] Who's pulling in lens? Maybe I can benefit from them if I already have to have them.
[ ] Bundle descriptor sets, render passes, and pipelines into a single abstraction
[ ] Toon Shader
[ ] MonadRenderer to be able to call mesh creation and such from SystemT
[ ] Linear types for resource management
[ ] Index buffer
[ ] Since for now we decide a game can ever only use one window, we could have the Ghengin monad propagate the window thorought the program
