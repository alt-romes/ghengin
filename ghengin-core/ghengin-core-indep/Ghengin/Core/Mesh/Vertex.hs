-- ROMES:TODO: It turns out alignment for Vertices is even something else entirely!!!
-- See FIR.Validation.Layout for information about the layout of vertice
-- information in shaders, slots (locations, components), and references to the
-- specification...
-- https://sheaf.gitlab.io/fir/FIR-Validation-Layout.html
--
-- The vulkan docs for shader layouts:
-- https://docs.vulkan.org/guide/latest/shader_memory_layout.html
--
-- std140 may be very slightly slower (?) if this were put under a lot of stress
-- (though it never will) -- for that case we could use existing vulkan
-- extensions to allow std430 for uniform buffers too (VK_KHR_uniform_buffer_standard_layout)
--
-- So I don't even know if it is possible to provide an instance for a vertex
-- of any attributes. Maybe FIR's Poke can do it...
--
-- Otherwise, we may only allow V4 vertice data and align to that...

-- It is kind of precarious to copy over the generic implementation here.
-- Would be better to implement Generic for Vertex, and derive generically Block.
-- May need this https://ryanglscott.github.io/2018/02/11/how-to-derive-generic-for-some-gadts/
-- But failed my attempts because I had to bring into scope type variables in the RHS of the type family and couldn't...
