OUTDATED!

All meshes are freed when the window is closed. However, if you change/discard a
mesh during the game you must free it explicitly. TODO: Enforce it somehow: linear types+reference counting

-- Outdated:
-- Initially there exist no references to this mesh, and if we never assign it
-- to a render entity it will never be freed. However, when a mesh is added to
-- a render packet using 'renderPacket', a reference count is added.
--
-- A mesh will only be freed when its reference count reaches zero.
--
-- If you delete/change meshes at runtime you must ensure they are freed
-- because we simply free them at the end. One must free the same meshes as
-- many times as they are shared for they will only be freed with the last
-- reference
