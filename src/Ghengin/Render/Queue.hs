Note [Render Queue]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The render queue is responsible for ordering the draw calls in such a way that
the amount of GPU state changes is minimized in order to optimize the rendering
engine.

TODO:
* Can we update the ECS storage order based on the render order?

* [Order your graphics draw calls around!](http://realtimecollisiondetection.net/blog/?p=86)

TODO
[ ]Â Use representation more efficient than simple lists?

The idea is to assign a key to each renderable entity and then do a simple sort
by key. This key must take into account GPU state changes amonsgt possibly other things.

Our key is 64 bits long:
* Nothing yet, eventually viewport related stuff, translucency
* 32bits for the material id
* Nothing yet, eventually depth sorting


Note [Material ID]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every material is uniquely identifiable by a 32bit key which serves to sort
material in order of binding frequency -- giving us an optimal order to render
entities with the minimal amount of state changes

The 32bit key is composed of:
* __6 bits__ for the (shader) pipeline identifier (this allows for a maximum of
  64 different shaders, which should be enough. If more are needed, you might
  need to merge two shaders into a more generic one (a generic material shader),
  which will probably be more performant than having more shaders)
* __26 bits__ to uniquely identify the material?
